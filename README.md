# Article-of-the-day scraper using Python

## Purpose
This script navigates to www.wikipedia.com and pulls only the pertinent info from the "random article" url, formats and displays it in the terminal.

## Tools 
- python
- requests module
- beautifulsoup module

### Further development
I'd like to automate running this script every morning.
